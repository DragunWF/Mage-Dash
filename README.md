## Description

Play as a mage hurling fire spells through a dangerous desert full of monsters.

The goal in this game is to simply survive as long as you can. To increase your score as much as possible. You can gain points/score by eliminating enemies and by staying alive.

**Difficulty scales over time;** the longer you survive, the tougher and faster the enemies become! Collect coins and upgrade your abilities through the shop to become stronger. Don't forget to pick up potions that wander around the desert as you go to power up. Furthermore, you also have the ability to use your coins to buy cosmetics in the shop if you prefer your mage to be fancy.

If you have any feedback or constructive criticism of my game, please do share it. I want to improve and grow as a developer.

This game is my submission to [One Game a Month #18](https://itch.io/jam/one-game-a-month-18) game jam and serves as one of my school projects.
